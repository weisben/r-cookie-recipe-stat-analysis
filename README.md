# Predicting Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Ratings

In this project, I use R to explore and analyze chocolate chip cookie recipes. I use a dataset from kaggle augmented through data scraping. The data is processed so that each entry represents a recipe and the proportions of ingredients present. I analyze how the ingredients predict the ratings of the recipes.
